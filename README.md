# Guess-Who-Ninja-Turtle-Edition-
Guess Who, but the only characters are the four ninja turtles. The Program will figure out who you've picked in three guesses.
The user must type in "yes" or "no" to interact with the program.
There is no GUI in this project.
The program starts with a list containing four classes of Ninja Turtle. Each question will prompt the user with a detail of one particular turtle.
For each incorrect guess the program removes that turtle from the list.
In this way it will take a maximum of 3 yes/no questions to figure out which turtle the user has chosen.
